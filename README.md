If you have Jupyter, you can download the `.ipynb` file, and see an interactive overview of the calculation results. If not, no worries, it's just an interactive version of the PDF.            
For the rest of the files, you can download them (.cmdx are CrystalMaker files, showing the surface relaxations). If you click the Play button in CrystalMaker, it should show a relaxation animation.   
The `LOCPOT` file shows the electrostatic potential in a 3D colour map at the 001 surface. I can give you the same for other surfaces if you think it'd be interesting.
